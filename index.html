        <p>I have created this site with myself and my physical organs (my mind, my senses, my hands). It took me a few days to create this website, and it was one of the most beautiful days. These days combined fatigue, thinking, innovation, and beauty as well. Now let me present to you my services that I will show you here on my site.!</p>

          <h2>Web Design</h2>
          <p>Web design is the creation of websites and pages to reflect a company's brand and information and ensure a user-friendly experience. You're designing a website, mobile app or maintaining content on a web page.</p>

          <h2>Web Development</h2>
          <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web). Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications.</p>

          <h2>HTML markup language</h2>
          <p>HTML is widely used to format web pages and web applications with the help of different HTML tags available in the language. HTML is almost compulsory to learn for students or software developers.</p>

          <h2>CSS Language</h2>
          <p>What is CSS? CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</p>

            <h2>Affiliate sites</h2>
            <p>An affiliate website offers an online store of products and resources in a specific niche. Think of them as digital boutiques catering to the tastes and interests of a select demographic.
              A great example of an affiliate site is Raymmar’s Reads — which functions as a digital book club where Raymmar shares books he likes and includes Amazon affiliate links. Raymmar uses 3D animations and nice color-shifting background transitions to make this simple site stand out.</p>

            <h2>Membership websites</h2>
            <p>If you’re already blogging, creating tutorials, or are thinking about launching an online course of your own, membership websites make it easy to get paid for what you create. There are many types of websites that offer memberships that unlock premium content that’s not available anywhere else.
              Most offer a basic level — giving people a taste of what’s available for free and then enticing them to sign up for their premium memberships. Becoming a paying member unlocks exclusive content like step-by-step tutorials, online courses, articles, videos, message forums where experts share tips, and more.</p>

            <h2>Online learning websites</h2>
            <p>Quite a few platforms out there will host online courses for you. But they come at a price. Why not launch your own site and avoid having to pay someone for what you could do on your own with a website builder like Webflow?
              Master the Handpan offers everything you need to learn how to play the handpan metal drum. The site includes three different levels of paid lessons — beginner, intermediate, and master class — plus a music theory course. Along with their instructional materials, Master the Handpan also has a buyer’s guide, discussion forum, and blog.

            <h2>Ecommerce websites</h2>
            <p>Online shops are a great side business that almost anyone can launch. Keep in mind that with so many ecommerce websites out there, you’ll be entering a competitive space — so make sure you have a solid brand identity and niche so you can set your online shop apart from the rest.
              L’intendance, a French purveyor of bulk and specialized food items, offers all of their products free of plastic packaging. They have a very specific marketing angle that reflects their brand identity of sustainability.
              With brilliant food photography and a clean and bright web design, there’s a crisp freshness to their website.</p>

            <h2>Restaurant website</h2>
            <p>You don’t need to run a restaurant to earn money from a restaurant website. You’d be surprised how many small businesses like restaurants have outdated websites or don’t have a website at all. If you have web design skills, consider reaching out to local businesses and pitch them on a website redesign package.
              Get to know the people who run some of your favorite restaurants and independent businesses and offer your design services. These types of projects won’t just put a bit of extra money in your pocket, but will also help you gain skills and experience as a designer.</p>
